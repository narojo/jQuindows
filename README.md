# jQuindows
Windows XP style UI written with HTML, CSS, and JQuery.

This started off as a simple web-based UI for <div> tag layout and positioning; I was developing unit tests for that functionality, and branched off this idea early in development.
  
  Some features include:
  - opening pointless 'windows'
  - start menu with pointless window ops
    - selecting all pointless windows
    - closing windows selected/active
  - clicking on a window assigns it active class
  - timestamp is printed to the taskbar area
  - recycling bin; when double-clicked, opens a window with printed array of closed windows

  Features in current development:
  - add window minimization feature
  -
